This is a program for creating a game of Domination. Follow this link to see a description:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVRVQM9lo9E. Data structure consists of three classes: Player, Board
and FocusGame. Using composition and object oriented programming this data structure uses modularized logic 
to create board, players and pieces. Allows players to enter game and make moves. Validates if move is within rules and 
updates players pieces appropriately. Checks for win conditions and sets turn to correct player.
